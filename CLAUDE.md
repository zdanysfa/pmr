# pmr — pm2 rewritten in Rust (fork mode)

Process manager daemon + CLI + Rust library in one crate. `src/lib.rs` is the
public API; the CLI (`src/main.rs`) is its first consumer.

## Project identity

Slogan: **efficient, high-performance, effective, less memory — better
performance and more production-grade than pm2**. Every public claim must be
backed by a measured number from `bench/bench.sh` or `bench/soak.sh` (current:
~14× less RAM, ~50× faster commands vs pm2). Never publish an unmeasured
performance claim.

## Working style

Use the **ponytail** skill/principle on every change: the laziest solution
that actually works — reuse what's here, stdlib before dependencies, shortest
diff, no speculative abstractions. New dependencies need strong justification
(the binary must stay small and auditable). Features beyond pm2 are welcome
when they serve production use (native log rotation and health checks exist
for exactly that reason), never for checkbox parity.

## Commands

```bash
cargo test                                  # 22 unit + 11 e2e + doctest
cargo test --test e2e                       # e2e only (spawns real daemons in /tmp)
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings   # CI gate
cargo fmt --check                           # CI gate
cargo run --example programmatic            # library API smoke test
```

Manual smoke: `PMR_HOME=/tmp/pmr-dev ./target/debug/pmr start script.sh && pmr ls`.
Always `pmr kill` afterwards and use a throwaway `PMR_HOME`.

## Architecture

- `src/ipc.rs` — wire protocol (ndjson over unix socket) + `ProcessSnapshot`; shared by everything.
- `src/client.rs` — `Pmr` client (sync, std-only). Auto-spawns the daemon binary.
- `src/daemon/supervisor.rs` — one tokio task per process instance; ALL restart
  semantics live in the pure `decide_restart()` (unit-tested; mirrors pm2 God.handleExit).
- `src/daemon/state.rs` — `Arc<Mutex<HashMap<u32, Proc>>>`; lock held microseconds
  only; long operations (kill sequences, delays) happen in supervisor tasks, never under the lock.
- `src/daemon/ops.rs` — shared operations (start/stop/restart); RPC, worker, cron,
  watcher all route through here so behavior stays in one place.
- Behavior contract comes from pm2 v7.0.3 (defaults: kill_timeout 1600ms,
  max_restarts 16, min_uptime 1000ms, backoff ×1.5 cap 15s). Don't change
  defaults without checking pm2 parity.

## Gotchas

- **Unix socket path limit (~108 bytes)**: `PMR_HOME` must be short. Tests use
  `/tmp/pmr-t-*`, never deep tempdirs.
- **Pinned nightly + edition 2024** (`rust-toolchain.toml`): clippy enforces
  let-chains (`if let ... && ...`). The bare `nightly` toolchain on some machines
  is a partial install — keep the dated pin.
- **`PMR_WORKER_INTERVAL` (ms)** overrides the 30s housekeeping tick — e2e tests
  set 300ms so max_memory_restart triggers fast.
- **Library spawns the daemon binary**, not `current_exe()` (host app would
  recurse): lookup order is `$PMR_BIN` → exe named `pmr` → sibling in cargo
  target dirs → `$PATH` (`client.rs::find_pmr_bin`).
- **`AppConfig` unknown fields** land in the flattened `env_profiles` map and are
  rejected by `validate()` unless prefixed `env_` — that's how `exec_mode: cluster`
  gets its clear fork-only error. `deny_unknown_fields` can't be used with `flatten`.
- **pm_id counter resets to 0 only when the table empties** (pm2 behavior);
  alloc + insert must happen under one lock.
- **e2e harness** (`tests/e2e.rs::Home`): unique `PMR_HOME` per test → fully
  parallel; `Drop` runs `pmr kill`. Assert on `jlist` JSON, not table output.
- Parent directory may be a pm2 source checkout (reference for audits); pmr is
  its own git repo — run git commands inside `pmr/`.
